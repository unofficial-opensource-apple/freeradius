FreeRADIUS 2.1.2 Fri Dec 5 17:40:00 CEST 2008;  , urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Allow running with "user=radiusd" and binding to secure
	  sockets.
	* Start sending Status-Server "are you alive" messages earlier,
	  which helps with proxying multiple realms to a home server.
	* Removed thread pool code from rlm_perl.  It's not necessary.
	* Added example Perl configuration to raddb/modules/perl
	* Force OpenSSL to support certificates with SHA256.
	  This seems to be necessary for WiMAX certs.

	Bug fixes
	* Fix Debian patch to allow it to build.
	* Fix potential NULL dereference in debugging mode on certain
	  platforms for TTLS and PEAP inner tunnels.
	* Fix uninitialized memory in handling of vendor definitions
	* Fix parsing of quoted (but non-string) attributes in the "users"
	  file.
	* Initialize uknown NAS IP to 255.255.255.255, rather than 0.0.0.0
	* use SUN_LEN in control socket, to avoid truncation on some
	  platforms.
	* Correct internal handling of "debug condition" to prevent it
	  from being over-written.
	* Check return code of regcomp in "unlang", so that invalid
	  regular expressions are caught rather than mishandled.
	* Make rlm_sql use <ltdl.h>.  Addresses bug #610.
	* Document list "type = status" better.  Closes bug #580.
	* Set "default days" for certificates, because OpenSSL won't
	  do it.  This closes bug #615.
	* Reference correct list in example raddb/modules/ldap.
	  Closes #596.
	* Increase default schema size for Acct-Session-Id to 64.
	  Closes #540.
	* Fix use of temporary files in dialup-admin.  Closes #605
	  and addresses CVE-2008-4474.
	* Addressed a number of minor issues found by Coverity.
	* Added DHCP option 150 to the dictionary.  Closes #618.

FreeRADIUS 2.1.1 Thu Sep 25 11:03:00 CEST 2008;  , urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Many more options and features in radmin.  See "man radmin" and
	  raddb/sites-available/control-socket
	* Many more commands available via the control socket.  Connect
	  via "radmin", and type "help" for more information.

	* Fixed issues with dynamic clients
	* Fixed configure checks for -lreadline
	* rlm_sqlippool no longer needs to be linked to rlm_sql.

	  See "man radmin" and raddb/sites-available/control-socket.

	Bug fixes
	* Double escaping of '\\' in the "users" (and some other) files
	  has been fixed.  If you have '\\' in the "users" file, your
	  configuration WILL NEED TO BE CHECKED, AND FIXED!
	* Parse "security" section in radiusd.conf.  This was accidentally
	  deleted in 2.0.5.  Closes bug #566.
	* Bind to interface before IP, which allows DHCP sockets to
	  listen on "*" for multiple interfaces.

	Feature improvements
	* Updated raddb/certs/ca.cnf with extensions to allow ca.der
	  to be imported as a CA on Symbian and Windows Mobile devices.
	  Closes bug #524
	* Enable multiple matches in "hints" via Fall-Through = Yes.
	  Closes bug #477
	* Added preliminary SQLite driver, contibuted by Apple.
	  Untested, with no sample configuration.  This address bug #470.
	* Updated logging sub-system so that log messages from libfreeradius
	  can go to the log file, and not stdout.
	* Added dictionary.rfc5176
	* EAP module now checks for instance name, and uses that for
	  authentication.  This avoids the need to set Auth-Type when
	  there are multiple instances of the EAP module.

	Bug fixes
	* Corrected typos in rlm_dbm.  Closes bugs #521 and #522.
	* Detail file "listen" sections now work much better.

	  occasional crashes on some systems.  Closes bug #518
	* Call correct function in rlm_protocol_filter.  This enables the
	  module to build.  Closes bug #512.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.2 ; Date: 2008/02/14 11:13:48  , urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Added notes on how to debug the server in radiusd.conf
	* Moved all "log_*" in radiusd.conf to log{} section.
	  The old configurations are still accepted, though.
	* Added ca.der target in raddb/certs/Makefile.  This is
	  needed for importing CA certs into Windows.
	* Added ability send raw attributes via "Raw-Attribute = 0x0102..."
	  This is available only debug builds.  It can be used
	  to create invalid packets! Use it with care.
	* Permit "unlang" policies inside of Auth-Type{} sub-sections
	  of the authenticate{} section.  This makes some policies easier
	  to implement.

	* Updated example raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel
	* Corrected behavior of attr_filter to match documentation.
	  This is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions!
	  See "man rlm_attr_filter" for details.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.1 ; Date: 2008/01/22 13:29:37  , urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* "unlang" has been expanded to do less run-time expansion,
	  and to have better handling of typed data.  See "man unlang"

	Bug fixes
	* The 'acct_unique' module has been updated to understand
	  the deprecated (but still used) Client-IP-Address attribute.
	* The EAP-MSCHAPv2 module no longer leaks MS-CHAP2-Success in

	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
        * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.

	  and the server configuation is *not* reloaded.
	* "check config" option now works.  See "man radiusd"
	* radrelay functionality is now included in the server core.
	  See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	* VMPS support.  It is minimal, but functional.
	* Cleaned up internal API's and names, including library names.
	
	Bug fixes
	* Many.
