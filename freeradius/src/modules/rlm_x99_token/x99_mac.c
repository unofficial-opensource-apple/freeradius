 * The X9.9 MAC is used by tokens in the following manner:

 * 1. Possibly convert the challenge to ASCII (eg "12345" -> 0x3132333435).
 *    Note that we do this unconditionally (we don't yet support tokens
 *    that can use raw challenge bytes (SafeWord Gold/Platinum)).
 * 2. Use the possibly converted challenge as the plaintext input to
 *    the X9.9 MAC algorithm.
 * 3. Convert the 32 bit MAC to ASCII (eg 0x1234567f -> "1234567f").
 *    Note that some tokens (SafeWord Gold/Platinum) can display a 64 bit MAC;
 *    we don't support those yet.
 * 4. Apply any vendor specific transformations on chars "a" thru "f".
 * 5. Use the result as the response.

 *
 * Most tokens support a max of an 8 character challenge, but at least one
 * (CRYPTOCard RB-1) supports performing the full CBC mode encryption
 * of an arbitrary length challenge.  So we don't limit ourselves
 * to just an ECB mode encryption.
 *
 * This routine returns the entire 64 bit last cipherblock, at least one sync
 * mode needs this (and ANSI X9.9 states that the MAC can be 48 and 64 bit
 * MACs should be supported).  Returns 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
