/*
 * Generate the State attribute, suitable for passing to pairmake().
 * challenge must be a null terminated string, and be sized at least
 * as large as indicated in the function definition.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.  For successful returns,
 * ascii_state (suitable for passing to pairmake()) and raw_state, if
 * non-NULL, will be pointing to allocated storage.  The caller is
 * responsible for freeing the storage.  raw_state will not be
 * null-terminated, the caller should know the expected size (any
 * variance is size is solely due to the length of the challenge arg).
 *
 * In the simplest implementation, we would just use the challenge as state.
 * Unfortunately, the RADIUS secret protects only the User-Password
 * attribute; an attacker that can remove packets from the wire and insert
 * new ones can simply insert a replayed state without having to know
 * the secret.  If not for an attacker that can remove packets from the
 * network, I believe trivial state to be secure.
 *
 * So, we have to make up for that deficiency by signing our state with
 * data unique to this specific request.  A NAS would use the Request
 * Authenticator, we don't know what that will be when the State is
 * returned to us, so we'll use the time.  So our replay prevention
 * is limited to a time interval (inst->maxdelay).  We could keep
 * track of all challenges issued over that time interval for
 * better protection.
 *
 * Our state, then, is
 *   (challenge + resync + time + hmac(challenge + resync + time, key)),
 * where '+' denotes concatentation, 'challenge' is the ASCII octets of
 * the challenge, 'flags' is a 32-bit value that can be used to record
 * additional info, 'time' is the 32-bit time (LSB if time_t is 64 bits)
 * in network byte order, and 'key' is a random key, generated in
 * x99_token_init().  This means that only the server which generates
 * a challenge can verify it; this should be OK if your NAS's load balance
 * across RADIUS servers by a "first available" algorithm.  If your
 * NAS's round-robin (ugh), you could use the RADIUS secret instead, but
 * read RFC 2104 first, and make very sure you really want to do this.
 *
 * Note that putting the time in network byte order is pointless, since
 * only "this" server will be able to verify the hmac, due to the unique
 * key.  But I've left it in there for future consideration of sync'd
 * keys across servers (eg, using the RADIUS secret, which is probably
 * not a good idea, or reading from a file, which might be OK.)
